This the Calculator Project (final project) from The Odin Project's Front End Fundamentals.

It features:

1)Functions for adding,substracting,multiplying and dividing numbers (integers and decimals)
2)A function for resetting the calculator and starting fresh
3)A function for undoing your last input (only allows for 2 consecutive undos as I couldn't make it to be 100% bug free)
4)A function for displaying the current result from all your operations 
5)Keyboard input

Note: It is not responsive on smaller screens
